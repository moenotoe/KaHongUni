In the testing, Firstly, I did't try to read the .ncl file . Instead, 
i tried to type token by token such as "SET","A" and then call 
the function to check if they are correct combination, if not , 
it would be ERROR and exit. 

After finish all the parsing, i extend the function and let it can be
interped. For the 'white-box testing', i tried to type token by token as well,
then when the current word are the keywords, i called the corresponding functions
to make it as a lisp, then call 'lisp_tostring' and use assertion to check
if the answers are correct(EX: when the current words is 'PLUS', i call the 
'int_PLUS_inter' function and then let it to be a string and use assertion
to check the answers). For using this method, i sperated many small lisp functions.

After finish the interpreter test, i wrote the functions to read the .ncl
files to achieve the 'black-box testing', i read the given .ncl files and 
type many extra files to exclude the additional situation that the given .ncl
files don't have.

In the extension part, I used the same way with interpreter.
